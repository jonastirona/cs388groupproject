# CS388 Group Project
### Jonas, Burhan, Serkan, Wassem

Version Control - Git
Feature Tracking - Github Projects

**App Ideas**

Jonas:
- ai finance tracker that categorizes expenses automatically, gives daily summaries, and provides insights for your finances - gamified like spotify wrapped maybe
- voice journal that transcribes/summarizes entries
- typing speed test like monkeytype but for mobile

Wassem:
- Pomodoro session tracker that tracks each 25-5 study increment sessions, logs them, and show a graph based off of your sessions. Graph would show average of how many hours studied, breaks taken, and days studied.

Burhan:
- App that allows users to set routes and compete with their friends on fastest laps. Friends can share their times with each other and compete on leaderboards. 
- ModMyCar is a mobile app for car enthusiasts of all ages to learn about modding, track build progress, and share projects with the community. Using the phone’s camera, microphone, and sensors, users can capture build photos, record performance stats, and showcase exhaust sounds. The app combines educational tools, cost estimates, and social features to help users plan upgrades, explore new ideas, and stay engaged in their car modding journey.
- Social media app for fisherman. Allows fisherman to post catches from different locations.

Serkan:
- Video casting app to cast web videos to smart tv's.
- Tuner + Metronome app that would allow the user to change bpm's and time signatures with a tuner functionality. It would also allow user's to record sound memo's and save them to their device.
- An app which would let users take pictures of sheet music or tabs and store them within the app. It could map out the sheet music and write down the correct notes.


**Top 3 Ideas:**
- Route Tracker 
    - Mobile: Tracks real-time location and speed. Also uses acceloremeter and gyroscope for detecting laps and performance analysis. Includes leaderboard with friends for the social aspect.
    - Story: The value of this app lies in socialability and competition. this app gamifies everyday driving. It offers a social, motivating reason to drive better.
    -  Market: Target audience would be car enthusiasts and social drivers
    -  Habit: Users would open it before and after drives and checking leaderboards. The leaderboard and competition aspect would keep users coming back
    -  Scope: It's a technically interesting but manageable for a student or startup-scale project. We could build a stripped down version featuring a limited area and then improve on it afterwards.
    
- ModMyCar
    - Mobile: Utilizes camera, accelerometer, and microphone to allow users to take photos of their car builds, record performance stats (0-60 times, quarter-mile times, etc.), as well as record exaust sounds.
    - Story: This app is very useful for members of the car community who want direction modding their car and a platform where they can track their current modding progress. This app will also serve as a platform for users to share their builds with other members of the community.  
    - Market: The car mod market is huge with many members of the car enthusiest community becoming more interested in participating. Amongst these consumers, the age varies from younger people just getting into modding their first cars to older folks who have been doing it for a while. The app appeals to enthusiasts of all ages by offering educational tools for learning about car modding, features to track progress on builds, and a social platform to showcase and share modifications.
    - Habit: Users would regularly check it to explore new modifications, monitor prices, or interact with new visualization ideas for their vehicles. Users can create their own car modification plans and can share them with others. The app’s use of push notifications and the regular new posts by other users would encourage users to return often, keeping them engaged in their car’s upgrade journey.
    - Scope: The app's implementation is manageable as it will be a social-media like app. Core Features would include car model selection, picture uploads, audio uploads, hierarchical visualization of modifications, and cost estimation. These features will be implemented using the phones sensors such as the camera and the mic alongside existing API's. A stripped down version of the app that only includes photo and audio uploads with cost estimation would still be highly engaging and valuable.
    
- Pomodoro Tracker 
    - Real-time timer & tracking, push notifications/reminders, and on-the-go session logging.
    - People can always do the pomodoro technique but can never actually track their progress. therefore, it would be beneficial to track progress and tweak studying based off of it
    - App value is very clear; it is tailored to students who are always looking to improve their studying sessions and make sure they're beneficially retaining information
    - Friends/peers would love this idea. The only downside is that majority of them don't have android.
    - Large market: students with androids in any educational institution.
    - This app has the potential to be a daily-routine addition throughout students' lives.
    - Only potential challenge for this app would be correctly logging and tracking the averages of the study sessions and mapping them for each day of the week


**Final App Idea:**
